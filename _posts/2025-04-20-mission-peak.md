I've been overthinking what to write here, so instead I'm gonna talk about a hike I did this sunday.

I walked up Mission Peak. It's a hike in the bay area, california. I went during the afternoon/sunset.

    {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/mission-peak/mission-peak-on-a-map.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>

It was nice. I went in the afternoon.

</div>
<div class="caption">
    Only the beginning of the adventure
</div>

There were cows.

        {% include video.liquid path="assets/img/mission-peak/cows.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true autoplay=true %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

And frogs, that I couldn't hear.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.liquid path="assets/img/mission-peak/frog.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true autoplay=true %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

</div>

A few of the rocks had hats on top of them, which intrigued me. I only managed to grab a photo of one. They looked nice and comfy.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/mission-peak/hat.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Whose hat is this
</div>

Sunset on the way down was nice.

    </div>

Thats it. Thats the post.
