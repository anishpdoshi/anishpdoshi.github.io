This doc is inspired by the idea of a [Manager README](https://svnk.github.io/manager-READMEs/). Although I am not a manager, I thought this would be a helpful manual for people to know me a bit more and make clear on what you could expect from me, especially when we work across teams.

## Who I am

- My name is pronounced `An-eesh` but I can recognize my name pretty easily no matter what variation of it is spoken.
- I’m currently based in SF. I originally came to the Bay Area from Illinois around 2013 to attend school at Berkeley. Since then, I’ve basically lived in every major “tech” area in the Bay - Berkeley, SF, Cupertino, Sunnyvale. I also visit NYC pretty often to see my sister, grandma, and some of my closest friends.
- I’m Indian American - I grew up in Barrington, Illinois, but my Mom and Dad are both from Gujarat, a state in northwest India.
- I speak English, decent Gujarati and an ever so tiny amount of Spanish (or at least Duolingo thinks so).
- I’m vegan, and if you hang out with me long enough, you might become vegan too.

## What you can expect from me

- I work job hours between 9 am and 5 pm PST. I’m passionate about my work, but if it’s after 5 pm, we should be brainstorming ideas or hacking on something cool and meaningful.
- I can get carried away in the hacking/ideating phase if you give me a cool problem
- I usually keep my phone off during working hours.
- I read all messages/notifications and aim to respond within a day. If I haven’t, send me a followup message, I’ll guarantee to respond within a day.
- I always keep my calendar up to date. If you need me for a meeting, please drop an invite at any empty slot. I acknowledge every meeting invite. I would tentatively accept it when I don’t know my availability just yet.
- Generally I do not get engaged in chatroom discussion very actively. If you have important information for me, email or p2p messenger are preferable. They just work better for me.

## When you talk to me

- Even though I grew up in a more “midwest”/laid back culture, I always prefer direct communication. If you think I am doing something wrong, please speak to me without filtering it. I do not get offended by any comment as long as it is honest and sincere.
- Many people would describe me as an idea person. I am proud about my constant flow of new ideas and very enjoy turning these ideas into working products. However, it does cause me to operate with many distractions and sometimes I would lose focus on the present. If you catch me not being focus on the spot, please do me a favour and call me out as loud as possible. This has always been one of my weakness I genuinely hope I can improve it.

## What I believe

- I firmly believe that talented people can self organize and make reasonable decisions to move things forward. I would encourage my management/peers to focus on setting the necessary context. I would do the same if I am in a position to delegate jobs to others.
- I work best in small, well understood codebases, and I encourage teams focusing on difficult problems to fully own their code E2E. Fast iteration, local demos, and “building 0-1 projects” are the best.
- Communication can be fun. Late night convos with a friend debugging some dumb problem or brainstorming ideas are always going to feel more
- Structure comes at a cost. There’s always a tradeoff to introducing a new process, new document to fill out, new beurarcracy in place. Please be mindful of that.
- I am deeply motivated by my interests in technology as well as recognition from people who share similar mindset. I am generally at my best when I am doing work I believe in and feel passionate about.

## What I am currently interested in

- Program synthesis, recommendation
- Language modeling & NLP
- Blending cool ideas in ML with beautiful products for humans.
- “Robust” AI in any form - making the outputs of LLMs more secure, controllable, and verifiable without compromising on their quality.

## Some work I am proud of

- I’ve jumped around a bit in my career so far, so work artifacts have varied and are sometimes behind NDAs :) But I am proud of the following things I’ve written. These aren’t always. But they reflect those late nights grinding out in OverLeaf, hacking on something with a few friends, or. You can get similar insights from my CV - but pdf/normative language constraints make it .
- Pattern profiler - a visual
- Genetic algorithm for pokemon - the code might need to be updated a bit
- 4 patents
- A controllable syntax guided synthesis algorithm [with Pei-Wei Chen]
- SQL synthesis algorithm
- A neural autoencoder
- PBE [thank you @rishabh singh]
- This paper I was a coauthor on with my sister @anjali. She’s a
- This Pong app I wrote in High School for AP CS. Look at the dancing graphics! Also, vector movements are surprisingly tricky - here’s my senior year report on the subject.

## What I do for fun

- Learning piano again
- Boxing classes
- Hiking
- Play chess. I’m OTB ~1100 but hoping to get better
- Sleep. Sleep is fun.
