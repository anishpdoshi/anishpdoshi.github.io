<!-- This doc is inspired by the idea of a [Manager README](https://svnk.github.io/manager-READMEs/). Although I am not a manager, I thought this would be a helpful manual for people to know me a bit more and make clear on what you could expect from me, especially when we work across teams. -->

## Who I am
* My name is pronounced `An-eesh` but I can recognize my name pretty easily no matter what variation of it is spoken. 
* I’m currently based in SF. I originally came to the Bay Area from Illinois around 2013 to attend school at Berkeley. Since then, I’ve basically lived in every major “tech” area in the Bay - Berkeley, SF, Cupertino, Sunnyvale. I also visit NYC pretty often to see my sister, grandma, and some of my closest friends.
* I’m Indian American - I grew up in Barrington, Illinois, but my Mom and Dad are both from Gujarat, a state in northwest India.
* I speak English, decent Gujarati and an ever so tiny amount of Spanish (or at least Duolingo thinks so). 
* I’m vegan, and if you hang out with me long enough, you might become vegan too. 

<!-- This section is true, if you're reading the source code, but i'm hesitant to put it in my about page as is. Feels a bit aggressive to put it here unless asked for. -->
<!-- 
## What you can expect from me
* I work job hours between 9 am and 5 pm PST. I’m passionate about my work, but if it’s after 5 pm, we should be brainstorming ideas or hacking on something cool and meaningful.
* I can get carried away in the hacking/ideating phase if you give me a cool problem
* I usually keep my phone off during working hours. 
* I read all messages/notifications and aim to respond within a day. If I haven’t, send me a followup message, I’ll guarantee to respond within a day.
* I always keep my calendar up to date. If you need me for a meeting, please drop an invite at any empty slot. I acknowledge every meeting invite. I would tentatively accept it when I don’t know my availability just yet.
* Generally I do not get engaged in chatroom discussion very actively. If you have important information for me, email or p2p messenger are preferable. They just work better for me.

## When you talk to me
* Even though I grew up in a more “midwest”/laid back culture, I always prefer direct communication. If you think I am doing something wrong, please speak to me without filtering it. I do not get offended by any comment as long as it is honest and sincere.
* Many people would describe me as an idea person. I am proud about my constant flow of new ideas and very enjoy turning these ideas into working products. However, it does cause me to operate with many distractions and sometimes I would lose focus on the present. If you catch me not being focus on the spot, please do me a favour and call me out as loud as possible. This has always been one of my weakness I genuinely hope I can improve it.

## What I believe
* I firmly believe that talented people can self organize and make reasonable decisions to move things forward. I would encourage my management/peers to focus on setting the necessary context. I would do the same if I am in a position to delegate jobs to others.
* I work best in small, well understood codebases, and I encourage teams focusing on difficult problems to fully own their code E2E. Fast iteration, local demos, and “building 0-1 projects” are the best.
* Communication can be fun. Late night convos with a friend debugging some dumb problem or brainstorming ideas are always going to feel more 
* Structure comes at a cost. There’s always a tradeoff to introducing a new process, new document to fill out, new beurarcracy in place. Please be mindful of that.
* I am deeply motivated by my interests in technology as well as recognition from people who share similar mindset. I am generally at my best when I am doing work I believe in and feel passionate about. -->

## What I am currently interested in
* Program synthesis, recommendation
* Language modeling & NLP
* Turning ideas in machine learning into human-compatible products
* “Robust” AI in any form - making the outputs of LLMs more secure, controllable, and verifiable without compromising on their quality.

## Some work I am proud of
* Here is a sample of things I have written that I take pride in. They reflect late nights grinding out research projects with grad school classmates, projects I built out for company hackathons that turned into full features, or just solo projects I thought were cool.

* This is a small selection as work artifacts are varied and mostly behind NDAs :) You can get similar insights from my [CV](/cv).

* [The transform-by-example feature at Trifacta (now Alteryx), which was inspired by BlinkFill](https://www.alteryx.com/blog/transform-by-example-your-data-cleaning-wish-is-our-command)

* [An autoencoder-based collaborative recommendation system for data transformation programs](https://www.alteryx.com/blog/collaborative-suggestions-community-driven-data-preparation)

* [An algorithm for using decision trees and symbolic regression to solve syntax guided synthesis problems with black-box oracles](/assets/pdf/smto_representation_learning.pdf)

* [Using a modified GAN to directly output mel-spectrograms that both visually and statistically fool CNN based speaker detection models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02384)

* [An end-to-end SQL synthesis platform blending prompt engineering, program ranking, and formal query postprocessing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hsdn5r4pA0tpqxLwnJ2RkVSHPVcMSkw1zTwnO_VZi_U/edit?usp=sharing)

* This [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.20.477106v1) I was a coauthor on with my sister, [Dr. Anjali Doshi](https://twitter.com/AnjaliDoshi16)

## What I do for fun
* Learning piano again, some classical songs
* Boxing
* Hiking
* Play chess online
* Sleep
